Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes all the three models classified the breed of the dog in Dog_01 to be the same breed. 
ResNet - dog_01.jpg: 
Real:  dog   Classifier: german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian
AlexNet - dog_01.jpg: 
Real:  dog   Classifier: german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian
Vgg - dog_01.jpg: 
Real:  dog   Classifier: german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes all the three model arch classified the breed of dog_01 to be the same breed of dog_02.
ResNet - dog_01.jpg: 
Real:  dog   Classifier: german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian
AlexNet - dog_01.jpg: 
Real:  dog   Classifier: german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian
Vgg - dog_01.jpg: 
Real:  dog   Classifier: german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
Yes all the three models correctly classified the other two images not to be dogs.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
The model can't be selected just like that. However, I can choose the models for specific requirements based on different parameters.
Based on simplicity and speed, I would choose AlexNet rather than Vgg and ResNet.
Based on the balanced performance, I would choose Vgg, if we are not aware of the dataset particularly.
Based of the performance, I would suggest ResNet, which constantly focuses on the accuracy of the model.
But all these three are capable of transfer learning.
